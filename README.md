# Overview

I created this text-based adventure game to test my knowledge and skill with C# and classes. Having self-taught myself the language I wanted to test my ability to apply what I have learned and create a project I can show to others.

The program runs an intro to a story I created and then prompts the user for a choice. Based on the user's input it will run the next part of the story and continue to prompt for choices until they reach the end of the story. Each choice leads the user down a different path and at the end the user will be given a final choice to either play again or end the program. I've utilized loops to make sure the user imputes something with each choice and if they input something that isn't one of the choices it warns them and prompts for them to retry.

The main purpose of this software was to push myself and my knowledge of C#. I have a passion for video games and this gives me a very small taste of what I could expect if I continue to pursue game development.

# Development Environment

To create this software I used Visual Studio Code and various forums to help with issues I encountered.

I used C# for this program and only used the available libraries built into C# I used the system library mostly to clear the screen to avoid cluttering the user's experience.

# Future Work

- Add more routes and longer story paths.
- Run more test conditions to prevent incorrect user inputs like integers, symbols, etc.
- Work on making a GUI for the game to allow it to be played outside of the terminal.
